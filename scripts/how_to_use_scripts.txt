**How to use
Run "./generate_table.sh [parameterFileName]".
Then an experiment is done with parameters in parameterFileName and a table is generated in ~/outputFiles.
ex) ./generate_table.sh delta_ex1_lin

You can also partially execute ./generate_table.sh which executes three scripts
(generate_inputs, run_benchmarks, read_logs). They also run with the parameter [parameterFileName].
ex) ./generate_inputs.sh delta_ex1_lin

Via ./generate_table.sh, you can only run epsilonRepSupM synthesis for a fixed kappa.
To perform the batch execution introduced in the paper, use eRepSupM_heuristics.sh.


**The main scripts
generate_inputs.sh	Translate .pp files into solver-ready ones (.mod, .m).
			They are put in ~/models/solverReady
run_benchmarks.sh	Execute solver with .mod or .m files generated by generate_input.sh.
			Execution logs are put in ~/outputFiles
read_logs.sh		Read logs generated by run_benchmarks.sh and generate spreadsheet in ~/tables
generate_table.sh	Run the three scripts above
eRepSupM_heuristics.sh	Performs a batch execution of epsilonRepSupM synthesis


**parameter files
env.sh			Specifies path info to the root
"parameters" folder	contains other parameters (type of martingale, the path to .pp files, etc.)


**auxiliary files
translate.sh		Called by generate_inputs.sh
